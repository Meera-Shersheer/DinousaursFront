  <li class="fb">Ankylosaurs' tail clubs would not have been much defense against a Tyrannosaurus rex.
     But their extremely tough armor might have foiled the 8-inch-long (20-centimeter-long) teeth of 
     the king of the dinosaurs.</li>
     <br>
     <li class="fb">Found in : Ankylosaurus roamed across the North American West </li> 
     <br>
      <li class="fb">Teeth shape :Ankylosaurs had little leaf-shaped teeth for nipping plants,
        It had few teeth compared to the duckbills and horned dinosaurs.</li> 
        <br>
  <li class="fb">
     even though they were slow moving, they were  hard to attack,becuase Ankylosaurus had 
     spikes on its head and side, a back covered with armored plates, and a tail that
     ended in a massive tail made of seven bones fused together into a hard and heavy mass so it was
     it was more spectacularly protected 
     from predators</li>
