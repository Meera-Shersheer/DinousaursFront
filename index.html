    <h2 class="space">What is a Dinosaur?</h2>
    <!-- a:anchor -->
    <p class="space">The name dinosaur comes from the Greek words deinos (“terrible” or “fearfully great”) and 
        sauros (“reptile” or “lizard”),
         and it is the common name given to a group of reptiles, often very large, that 
        first appeared roughly 245 million years ago  and thrived
         worldwide for nearly 180 million years.
          Most died out by the end of the Cretaceous Period, about 66 million
          years ago, but many lines of evidence now show that one lineage evolved into birds about 155 million years ago.

        <li> Dinosaur fossils have been found on all seven continents.</li>

        <li>  Paleontologists use fossil evidence preserved in ancient rock to discover
             how long-extinct animals lived and behaved.

        <br>
       
        <li>  In most cases, a fossilized bone is actually a rock made out of minerals, with no trace of the original
             bone material.</li>
             <br>
        <li> The discovery of dinosaur eggs and nests provided evidence for the behavior of some dinosaurs.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Until recently it was believed that feathers were unique to birds. Recent discoveries, 
            however, have unearthed evidence for feathered non-avian dinosaurs</li>
        <br>
        <li>Series of fossilized footprints, called trackways, reveal some intriguing evidence about dinosaur behavior

<h2 class="space">The extinction</h2>

  
    <p class="space">
        There are several theories as to what may have contributed to the mass extinction of non-avian
    dinosaurs and other species at the end of the Cretaceous Period. It is certain that a
         massive asteroid or comet struck Earth during this time, causing a dramatic shift in Earth’s climate. 
         Some scientists speculate that this impact had catastrophic consequences for life on Earth. But other factors, 
         including changing sea levels and large-scale volcanic activity,
          may also have played a significant role in this mass extinction.
